# Pickle
A garry's mod gamemode. The exact project goal isn't established other than to learn GLua (and lua itself) and create an interesting gamemode. The name of the repo is only a project name, and won't be the final gamemode name.

Project Started 8/9/2022

## Project Ideas & Goals
The goal is to create a roleplay gamemode (yes, as if there is not enough already) where the setting/atmosphere for the gamemode will be post-apocalyptic.

## Planned Features
- Hunger
- Player Stats
- Event System
- Crafting
- skill-Aligned Occupations
- Traits
- Races

## Features in Detail
### Hunger
The player will have to cope with hunger, it will slowly rise (or decrease by an amount) over time. Hunger won't kill the player, but only affect their stats. 

### Event System
Events can occur randomly or at any given time.

### Player Stats
Players will be able to select from a collection of stats. Having points in these stats will yield special abilities/ bonuses for the player.

### Skill-Aligned Occupations
Players will not be able to instantly choose their Job, similar to DarkRP, they will have to obtain the knowledge that is required for a certain occupation.

### Crafting
Some skill-Aligned occupations will have crafting.

### Races
The gamemode will be very similar in nature to Fallout, and can include some of the races included in the series. Ghouls, Super Mutants, etc. Since this gamemode isn't based directly on (or a clone/mirror of) Fallout, we can include all types of races.

### Traits
Traits can be chosen on character creation. This system will be similar to Project Zomboid's system. However, the player will only be able to pick 1 trait. Every trait has a positive and a negative.
